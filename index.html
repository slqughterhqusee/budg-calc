        <p>The traditional 50/30/20 budgeting strategy distributes money towards needs, wants, and savings. However,
            sometimes life isn't cut into such specific categories. Many needs and wants overlap; living an enriching
            life is important. This budget calculator will replace 'wants' with 'life', helping to shift your view.
            Instead of cutting fun things out because they're 'less important', think about what contributes to the cost
            of them!</p>

    <section class="p1">
        <p>If you don't have a job, but you want to see how life might look like with one, feel free to pick from the
            list! Behind the scenes, we first determine your monthly income. Next, we deduct 32.65% in taxes (an
            estimate determined by the EECU). Fun fact: Using the percent strategy, your maximum housing payment should
            be only 33% of your post-tax monthly income! </p>

                        If you're running low on money, decrease the amount you're putting in savings.

                        Try maximising the products you use in your hobbies to make less purchases: Save the scraps!

                        Money is wasted on uneaten food. When in a tight spot, focus on meal planning foods you know
                        you'll like to make the most of leftovers!

                        Keep the lights off until it gets dark, and only keep them on when you're in the room.

                        Invest in entertainment that charges monthly (such as a single streaming service) and meet with
                        friends at home instead of spending money out!
